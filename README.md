# microscope-clone

A reddit-like discussion website that I created using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) based of tutorials from [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com)

Live site (may have to refresh a couple of times since it's on free hosting): [mishaslinkshare.meteor.com](http://mishaslinkshare.meteor.com/)

##Goal

I am building this website to gain experience in creating web applications and web paradigms. I chose the [Meteor framework](https://www.meteor.com) because it seemed like a good tool for quickly and efficiently getting a live example up and running (especially with a one-man team such as myself).

##Features

 - Create posts that link to interesting websites!
 - Discuss posts in comments!
 - Organize posts by "Most Recent" or "Most Upvoted"!
 - Notifications when someone comments on your post!
 
 
##TODO
This is a finished project.
 
##Contributing
Feel free to experiment, but personally, I am moving on to my next project.
